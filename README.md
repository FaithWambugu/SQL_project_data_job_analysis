FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id     =company_dim.company_id
WHERE  job_location = 'Anywhere'  AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND            salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

WHERE   job_location = 'Anywhere'  AND 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)
SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
